## About

Manuel Bastioni was active in open source projects since 1999.

Member of Blender Artist community since 2002.

He was one of the authors of "The Official Blender 2.3 guide, the open 3D creation suite", writing the chapter "From Blender to YafRay Using YableX"

In 2000 he started Makehuman Project, a free and open source software for the modelling of 3d photo-realistic characters, winner of "Suzanne Award" as the best python script for Blender 3D in 2004. He left the MakeHuman project in 2016.

He is the author of Manuel Bastioni Laboratory, a free and open source add-on for Blender to create 3d humanoids. It includes the results of years of prototyping and studies realized by him during the development of his 3d graphics projects.

This fork is an attempt to keep this addon going towards the next generation of Blender as the original author is no longer developing ManuelBastioniLAB
